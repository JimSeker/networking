ReST Services /API
===============
Demo of how to use rest services with android.

`RestDemo1`  uses JSON and a nice demo website.  Accessible to anyone.

`RestDemo2` show insert, update, query, and delete using a local ReST API.  note, the webserver is likely unaccessible from the outside world.  See the www directory for the necessary web scripts.

`RestDemo3` show a simple image display app, using a webserver to get the list and then it uses an thread to retrieve the images.

`www` are php scripts used for ReSTDemo2.  You will need a machine with php and Maria/Mysql to run these.
